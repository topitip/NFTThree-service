# Digital Tree NFT Project 🌳

Digital Tree NFT is an innovative project that bridges art, blockchain, and sustainability. Designed for a hackathon, the project showcases how technology can inspire a greener future by allowing users to interact with and nurture unique digital trees on the blockchain.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. **Interactive NFTs**
- Users can "water" their digital trees to nurture them and improve their condition.
- The trees dynamically reflect their state:
    - **Healthy**, **Neutral**, or **Withered**, depending on user interactions and time.
- Each tree represents a commitment to sustainability and can be minted as an NFT.

### 2. **Dynamic Designs**
- Every tree is unique, generated from combinations of different trunks, leaves, and backgrounds.
- Assets are a mix of **hand-drawn** and **AI-generated designs**, making each NFT truly special.

### 3. **Blockchain-Powered**
- Built on the **ERC721 standard** for NFTs.
- Deployed on the **Mantle Sepolia Testnet**, a robust and scalable blockchain.
- Users can connect their wallets, manage their digital trees, and mint NFTs seamlessly.
